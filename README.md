RomieStay is an intuitive hotel booking system developed using Python, designed to offer a seamless and efficient experience for users looking to book hotel rooms. The system caters to both customers and administrators, making it an all-encompassing solution for hotel reservations and management. Customers can easily register, log in, and explore a range of hotels with detailed information such as location, room charges, available rooms, and star ratings.

A key feature of RomieStay is its ability to offer holiday discounts, applying a 10% discount on room charges during special holidays like Republic Day, Diwali, and other popular celebrations. This provides users with the opportunity to save money while enjoying a comfortable stay.

The system tracks real-time room availability, ensuring that users can only book rooms that are actually available for their selected dates. It also allows users to cancel bookings, view their booking history, and generate detailed invoices with clear breakdowns of costs. The customer dashboard is designed to offer easy navigation, making it simple for users to manage their bookings.

On the administrative side, RomieStay offers a dedicated admin panel where administrators can manage hotel listings, track bookings, and view detailed reports of room availability, earnings, and customer bookings. Admins can also view customer-specific booking information, giving them insight into hotel usage and revenue.

Technically, RomieStay is built using Python with several core concepts like functions, dictionaries, lists, and date manipulation. For instance, the booking system uses Python's datetime module to manage date inputs and bookings. The system performs date validation to ensure that users cannot book rooms outside the allowed booking window (2025–2027) and that end dates are not earlier than start dates. The program also uses try-except blocks to handle incorrect date formats and inputs. User authentication and account management are managed through simple dictionary structures, ensuring quick and efficient lookups and updates. The program also utilizes dictionaries to store hotel data, including the number of rooms, booking records, per-day charges, and earnings.

RomieStay is a well-rounded hotel management system that showcases practical Python concepts like working with user input, file management (for persistent data storage), and the integration of logic for holiday discounts. The program also demonstrates the use of modular code with functions that handle specific tasks like booking rooms, viewing bookings, and displaying hotel details. This project serves as a great example of how Python can be used to create real-world applications and is ideal for those looking to learn Python programming while building a functional system. Whether you’re traveling for business or leisure, RomieStay ensures a hassle-free, enjoyable experience for your next hotel stay.
